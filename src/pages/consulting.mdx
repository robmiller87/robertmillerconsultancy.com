## Cut Through the Noise. Ship Something Real.

Everyone's talking about AI agents. Most people are stuck at the demo stage.

I've spent the last year deep in the trenches — deploying agents that run 24/7, building on-chain infrastructure for agent commerce, and figuring out what actually works versus what sounds good on Twitter.

If you're serious about building with agents but don't want to waste months on wrong turns, I can help you get there faster.
