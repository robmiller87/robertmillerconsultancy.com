## The Through-Line

What got Robert into crypto wasn't the money — it was the possibility that ordinary people could access financial infrastructure without asking permission.

That same instinct now draws him to AI — not as a product to consume, but as a capability to own. And to physical communities designed from first principles, not inherited defaults.

The tools evolve. The question stays the same: *who gets access to power?*
