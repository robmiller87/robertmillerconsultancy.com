title: "Something Shifted This Week"
description: "I spent a week working alongside AI agents. The productivity gains weren't incremental — they were structural. That has consequences."

I had a moment on Tuesday that I haven't been able to shake.

I was building out a workflow — nothing glamorous, just automating a set of research tasks that normally take me the better part of a morning. The kind of thing I'd usually sketch out, half-build, get frustrated with, and either finish over two days or abandon. This time I was working with Claude Code, one of Anthropic's AI agents, alongside a tool called Clawdbot that ties it all together. I described what I wanted, refined it a few times, and had it running inside of forty minutes.

Not a rough draft. Not a proof of concept. A working system, doing real work, saving me real hours.

And here's what I can't stop thinking about: I'm one person, in Biarritz, messing around with early tools. What happens when this reaches the people who actually build things at scale?

I've been trading and operating in markets long enough to know the difference between a good story and a structural shift. Good stories move prices for a quarter. Structural shifts rearrange who makes money and how for a decade. And the pattern I keep recognizing — in my own usage this week, in what I'm seeing from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and a dozen smaller labs — looks a lot more like the latter.

The AI agents shipping right now are not the chatbots from two years ago. Those were parlour tricks — impressive but disconnected from actual workflow. What's arriving now plugs directly into the work itself. Code gets written, reviewed, and deployed. Research gets structured and synthesised. Operational tasks that used to require a junior hire or an outsourced contractor are getting handled by systems that cost a few dollars a month and don't need onboarding.

I keep using the word *agents* because it matters. These aren't tools you query — they're systems that execute. The difference is the same as the difference between a search engine and an employee. One gives you information. The other does the job.

The productivity literature is full of moments where a new technology promised transformation and delivered something more modest. I've seen enough hype cycles to be wary. But I've also been around long enough to know what it feels like when the thing actually works. And this week, it worked.

---

So here's the reframe, and it's the one I keep running numbers on.

If AI agents deliver even a fraction of the productivity gains I experienced this week — not across every sector, not perfectly, just in knowledge work, software, research, operations, and content — the macroeconomic implications are enormous. And I don't mean in the hand-wavy "fourth industrial revolution" sense. I mean in the way that shows up in earnings reports, GDP prints, and monetary policy decisions within the next twelve to eighteen months.

Let me be specific, because vague bullishness is worthless.

**Productivity and growth.** The US has been grinding along at roughly 1.5–2% productivity growth for years. AI-driven tooling, if adoption curves follow what I'm seeing in tech-forward companies, could push that toward 3% or higher. That's not a small thing. A sustained jump in productivity growth is the single most powerful force in economics. It means more output without proportionally more input. It's disinflationary. It's earnings-accretive. And it changes the math on almost everything else.

**The dollar.** This is where it gets interesting. Higher productivity growth in the US, relative to Europe and Asia, is structurally dollar-positive. Capital flows toward productivity. If the US becomes the clear leader in AI-driven output — which right now it is, and it's not close — the DXY has room to strengthen even as the Fed eventually cuts. That's a divergence trade that most macro funds aren't positioned for yet, because the consensus still assumes dollar weakness on rate differentials. I think they're looking at the wrong variable.

**Tech equities.** The Nasdaq has been a concentration problem for years. The Mag Seven narrative is well-worn and everyone knows the risk. But here's the thing: concentration is a problem when the concentrated names are overearning relative to their growth trajectory. If AI tools actually accelerate the revenue and margin story for the big platforms — and for the infrastructure layer beneath them — the concentration might be justified, or even insufficient. The S&P 500 could see earnings growth that surprises to the upside in the second half of 2026, not because of financial engineering, but because companies are genuinely doing more with less. That's a different kind of earnings beat. A more durable one.

**Bitcoin.** We're roughly eighteen months past the last halving. Historically, this is the sweet spot — supply compression has fully priced in, institutional flows are established, and the narrative shifts from scarcity to adoption. If AI drives a genuine economic boom, Bitcoin benefits from the broader risk-on environment. But it also benefits from something more specific: AI agents need to transact. They need payment rails that are programmable, permissionless, and global. Crypto infrastructure — stablecoins, smart contracts, on-chain settlement — is a natural fit for agent-to-agent commerce. That's not a 2026 story yet, but it's becoming a 2027 one, and markets price forward.

**Ethereum and the broader ecosystem.** ETH has been frustrating for a while. The merge happened, Layer 2s shipped, and the price action has been... uninspiring. But if you believe that AI agents will need programmable infrastructure to operate at scale — and I do — then Ethereum's smart contract ecosystem becomes a picks-and-shovels play for the agent economy. The question is timing. The market has been impatient with ETH's complexity. That impatience might flip into urgency once agent-to-agent transaction volumes start showing up on-chain.

Here's where I want to be careful, because I can feel my own conviction pulling me forward and that's exactly when a trader needs to check himself.

The history of technology adoption is littered with "this changes everything" moments that didn't. The internet was going to eliminate middlemen — and then created the biggest middlemen in history. Mobile was going to democratize everything — and then concentrated power into two app stores. AI could follow a similar path: genuinely transformative, but on a timeline and in a shape that surprises even the bulls.

The risks are real. Regulation could slow deployment. A major AI failure — something that damages trust at scale — could set adoption back by years. The productivity gains I experienced might not translate as cleanly to large organisations with legacy systems and institutional inertia. And markets have a tendency to price in the future before the future arrives, which means the trade could get crowded before the fundamentals catch up.

I also know that my own experience this week — the forty-minute build that would've taken me two days — is a sample size of one. It's vivid, it's compelling, and that's exactly why I need to hold it loosely. Traders who fall in love with their own thesis blow up. That rule doesn't have exceptions.

But here's what I keep coming back to.

Every morning this week, I've sat down and the tools were better than the day before. Not in some abstract benchmark sense — better at doing the things I actually need done. The improvement curve is steep and it's compounding. And when I zoom out from my own desk and think about what happens when a few million knowledge workers have the same experience over the next six to twelve months — when CFOs start seeing the productivity data, when earnings calls start referencing AI-driven margin expansion not as a forward promise but as a current reality — the macro picture shifts.

I'm not making a prediction. Predictions are for people who need to sound confident. What I'm doing is orienting. Positioning myself to benefit if the boom materialises, while keeping the downside defined if it doesn't. Options, not convictions. Exposure, not commitment.

My conviction is growing. Rapidly. But I've been in this game long enough to know that growing conviction is a feeling, and feelings make terrible risk managers.

So the question I'm sitting with: if this is real — if AI-driven productivity actually bends the growth curve in 2026 — what are you exposed to? And if it doesn't, what do you lose?

The best trades are always the ones where you can answer both questions honestly.
